    <h2>A numerical representation of a piece of information</h2>
<p>This week one of my delights was being exposed to the world of
<a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/getting-started-with-embeddings">embeddings</a>, which
is a method commonly used in the machine learning space when wanting to capture
the semantic meaning of what is being embedded.</p>
<p>It is another example of the prominence of vectors in this space and how what is
ultimately a simple mechanism, can provide great value (when applied
appropriately). The linked blog post does a good job of running one through a
query -&gt; FAQ scoring exercise. I did worked through that using a personal data
set and it was fun. Recommend!</p>
<p>As an aside, I am super impressed with what <a href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging
Face</a> is doing to democratize machine learning stuff.
The field has felt long-inaccessible, but here is a space with the right
community, tooling, and guidance to open the door to many more.</p>
<h2>fly.io</h2>
<p>I started a side project and chose <a href="https://fly.io/">fly.io</a> for my deployment.
I was impressed with the quick startup time. I'll be attempting a project which
blends a bit of machine learning and live lookups at the edge to provide a
snappy result. More on what that actually means soon; hoping to sprint on a
2-week MVP when things calm down with life / work. (do they ever? ... yes)</p>
<h2>Viewing</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10954984/">Nope</a> I am seeing Jordan Peele's
  newest flick later today. I appreciate his work because he doesn't hold back,
  isn't afraid of some in-your-face social commentary, and is a great writer
  overall.</li>
