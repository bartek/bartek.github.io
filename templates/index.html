<h1><a href='{{ url_for("index") }}'>👋 Hello, I'm Bartek</a></h1>

    <p>I'm a 30-something Polish dude raised mostly in Toronto, Canada, currently living
    in Boston, Massachusetts. Apart from building software, I spend most of my
    time being a loving father, cooking, travelling, and nerding out over
    transportation systems.</p>

    <h3>A little more about me</h3>

    <p>I work at <a href='https://www.gadventures.com'>G Adventures</a>, a
    sustainable tourism company working hard to make the world a better place.
    I've been there longer than I ever anticipated, but the challenges keep
    coming. Want to work with us? <a href='mailto:hello@justbartek.ca'>Talk to me</a>.</p>

    <p>I'm currently reading Edward Snowden's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Record_(autobiography)'>Permanent Record</a></p>

    <p>My current project revolves around improving the ability for
    documentation to be discovered and connected within an organization. I hope
    to have more to share soon.</p>

    <p>My current travel ambitions are to see more of the United States, now
    that I'm here (since September 2019)</p>
