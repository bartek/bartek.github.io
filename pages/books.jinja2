<p>I've set a goal of reading 12 books in 2020. On this page, I list the books I
have read, am reading, or failed to read (started, couldn't finish)</p>

<p>I have a bad habit of reading plenty of 5-10 minute pieces, love the news, and consume plenty of podcasts. However,
I struggle to sit down with a book. Taking my time back is one an important goal of 2020 for me, hence, the desire
to sit down, relax, and enjoy a quality paperback.</p>
