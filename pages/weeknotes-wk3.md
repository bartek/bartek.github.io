## Parenting

This week has been tough for extracurricular activity. Wife departed for a work
offsite and thus, I've been parenting solo all week. The result has been days
focused on keeping the house together and the day job. The minimal downtime I
had in the evening was used to watch some TV, in this case
[Yellowjackets](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11041332/). It's been a surprising
ride through mystery and supernatural.

There is fun to be had in solo parenting (for short bursts of time). We've
changed it up each day, went out for ice cream during the week, and had some fun
mornings & evenings. Keeping it simple.

As a reminder, it takes a village to parent successfully. Build yours (if you
weren't born into one :-))

## Tracing

At work, I spent some of my time this week wrapping my head around how we should
implement tracing in one of our applications, with the goal of expanding that
surface area to further integrations & applications as they come online.

I found O'Reilly's [Distributed Tracing in
Practice](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/distributed-tracing-in/9781492056621/) to be a great introduction and way to develop a fundamental understanding.

As with most things in the instrumentation space, the way to approach your
particular problem is more art than science, with a heavy lean to the context of
your use case.

## NYC

Next week I'll be in New York city for my own work offsite. I expect to eat
great food, run through some interesting neighbourhoods, and spend some quality
time with my coworkers (who I work with remotely)
