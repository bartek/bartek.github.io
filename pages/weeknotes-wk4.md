I skipped a week of notes! My attempt to form a habit is already slipping.
However, I had a good excuse: New York city :-)

Spent the week prior in Manhattan with coworkers for an offsite. Met a good
chunk of the team for the first time (in person), ate some really good food, and
got to walk the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

## Summer Hours

Between juggling a busy time at work, I am also enjoying the heck out of summer.
Somehow we are making it work, and it's mostly because our weekends are spent
outdoors, generally on a beach. I would say it's exhausting but I struggle to
use that word for something that genuinely brings me joy (my kids enjoying the
sun, and well, me too)

## Viewing

* [Prey](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11866324/) the movie was surprisingly fun
* [The Bear](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14452776/) is a show about a
  dysfunctional Chicago restaurant. Episode 2 has aired and the show is
  developing well -- keeping an eye on this one.
* [For All Mankind](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7772588/). Season 3. What
  happened?

Not much else to say this week. Lots of work and play.
