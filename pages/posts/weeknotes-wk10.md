Fall has officially arrived and the kids wore balaclavas and mitts for the morning bike
rides. I suffered one day when I chose to wear a t-shirt. Those Nova Scotian winds can
be harsh.

Recently I discovered [generative music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_music
), which is described as music that is ever-different and changing, and that is created
by a system. A common place to hear this type of music is an
[Algorave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorave), which sounds like an absolutely
incredible night! There seems to be a community around these events, as [live dates
continue to pop up](https://algorave.com/). Sadly, none in Canada, but to be fair, I'm
not going to be staying up past 10pm any time soon :-)

The discovery began on TikTok, which I continue to curate to bring me the ideal 15
minute couch session. (the algorithm can work _for you_, but it does take discipline
and lots of tuning!) There, I stumbled on two creators:

* [dj_dave__](https://www.tiktok.com/@dj_dave__)
* [switch.angel](https://www.tiktok.com/@switch.angel)

Both are operating at another level. This is mastery of not only the programming
language but music theory. They are also really fun to listen to! In particular, I
enjoy how Switch Angel's descriptions of what they are building act its own sort of
background music.

The music is created through a platform known as [strudel](https://strudel.cc/). I lack any music theory,
but I popped open some of those TikTok videos and began writing some code (strudel repl
happens to have some vim bindings, nice!)

It's really fun. I enjoy the visuals you get out of box (via `punchcard`) and the
variation you can produce is pretty vast.

All this reminded me of a conference talk by [Sam
Aaron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCZaqKTwtvQ), who I was lucky to see speak at
GOTO Chicago back in 2018. The linked is from a different conference, but same idea. His talk spoke to choices within the school curriculum (from his home country) and the possibilities of education through live coding & music. Today, his talk remains relevant and I think even more interesting now that our youth are growing up more closely with computers!

I don't anticipate becoming a algorave coder, but I have been enjoying popping in and
out of strudel to try things out. I found the following as other interesting projects
in this space:

* [Csound](https://csound.com/get-started.html) 
* [supercollider](https://supercollider.github.io/)
* [faust](https://faust.grame.fr/)
* [https://sonic-pi.net/](sonic-pi) (per Sam's video above)
