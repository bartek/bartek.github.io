I cook — a lot — for the whole family. These are my notes as they come to me.
It's a combination of culinary discoveries as well as tips that are typically
applicable to a variety of dishes.

* 09/05/2023: TikTok (specifically, [@haileecatalano](https://www.tiktok.com/@haileecatalano?lang=en) changed how I make pizza sauce. Previously would cook pasata with spices, herbs, oil. Now, I dump a canned of Kirkland diced tomato into a bowl, add spices (salt, pepper, choice of dry herbs), and a drizzle of honey. Mash that up, done! Beautiful & rich pizza sauce.
* 09/05/2023: To make an excellent pomodoro, it can be as simple as butter, onion, and good (canned or fresh) tomatoes. The onion poaches in the tomato sauce and the butter adds a creamy flavour & texture. Once the onion is translucent it is removed, and the sauce is done (season to your liking)
* 09/05/2023: Used white pepper for the first time today, in a sesame chicken dish. It added a earthy, almost herby (bon appétit [describes it as *herbaceous*](https://web.archive.org/web/20230326211958/https://www.bonappetit.com/story/white-pepper)). Will try it with pork next!
