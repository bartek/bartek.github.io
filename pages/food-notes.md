I cook — a lot — for the whole family. These are my notes as they come to me.
It's a combination of culinary discoveries as well as tips that are typically
applicable to a variety of dishes.

* 12/09/2023: Crepes were our flat bread growing up. My mother would make a large batch in the morning, we'd enjoy for breakfast, and a pile would sit throughout the day. Quick snack with a slice of ham after school, or my favourite: strawberry jam. They are fool-proof, despite their usual decadent presentation. 2 eggs, one heaping  cup of flour, pinch salt/sugar, then whatever dairy's in the fridge — usually a mix of yogourt and kefir. Whisk until thick, let sit for a bit, then dilute with water, done! Not as hard as the world makes it out to be :)
* 11/08/2023: Katsu Curry is a wonderful confluence of my childhood and modern food interests in one. The fried pork loin takes me back, and the rich curry (with apple! key!) elevates everything to a place my current palate highly appreciates. My goto recipe is from [a wonderful Japanese couple](https://www.cabagges.world/tokyo-katsu-curry)
* 09/26/2023: Never throw a chicken carcass away. Use it for stock or gravy, then rid of it. Also, I prefer to burn my onion (on the BBQ side burner) for additional unami in the stock.
* 09/26/2023: Making your own bread is one of life's greatest hacks.
* 09/07/2023: Always toast your spices.
* 09/05/2023: TikTok (specifically, [@haileecatalano](https://www.tiktok.com/@haileecatalano?lang=en)) changed how I make pizza sauce. Previously would cook pasata with spices, herbs, oil. Now, I dump a canned of Kirkland diced tomato into a bowl, add spices (salt, pepper, choice of dry herbs), and a drizzle of honey. Mash that up, done! Beautiful & bright pizza sauce.
* 09/05/2023: To make an excellent pomodoro, it can be as simple as butter, onion, and good (canned or fresh) tomatoes. The onion poaches in the tomato sauce and the butter adds a creamy flavour & texture. Once the onion is translucent it is removed, and the sauce is done (season to your liking)
* 09/05/2023: Used white pepper for the first time today, in a sesame chicken dish. It added a earthy, almost herby (bon appétit [describes it as herbaceous](https://web.archive.org/web/20230326211958/https://www.bonappetit.com/story/white-pepper)). Will try with pork next!
